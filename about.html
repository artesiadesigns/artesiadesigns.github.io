          <div id="heritage" class="dropdown-content">
             <p>Lippan art, also known as mud and mirror work, is a stunning form of traditional Indian folk-art originating from the Kutch region of Gujarat. What makes Lippan art truly captivating is its intricate use of mud and mirrors to create mesmerizing patterns and designs.
             <p>The designs in Lippan art often feature geometric patterns, floral motifs, and symbolic representations inspired by nature and folklore. Each piece is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, with artisans using their fingers or simple tools to shape the mud and embed the mirrors. This is a mixed media art form â€“ wood, acrylic paint, clay, mosaic mirrors.

          </button>
          <div id="significance" class="dropdown-content">
            <p>The patterns in Lippan art are not arbitrary; they are deeply rooted in the cultural narratives of the Rabari community. Common motifs include peacocks, elephants, and geometric shapes, which are believed to bring blessings and protection. The process of creating Lippan art is often a communal activity, bringing women together to share stories, skills, and traditions. Thus, Lippan art is as much about community and heritage as it is about aesthetics.</p>

              <p> The journey of creating custom Lippan art begins with understanding the customer's vision and evaluating their space. We collaborate with clients to gather details about their preferences, decor style, color schemes, and the dimensions of the area where the artwork will be displayed. Once the concept is finalized, we carefully craft the design, starting with a durable base and shaping intricate patterns with a special clay or gypsum mixture. Mirrors are added to enhance the artwork's elegance, and the piece is completed with finishes that align with the client's aesthetic. This personalized approach ensures each creation is a perfect blend of tradition and modernity, tailored to the customer's unique space. </p>

Modern artisans have also experimented with different materials and designs, expanding the scope and reach of this art form.</p>
